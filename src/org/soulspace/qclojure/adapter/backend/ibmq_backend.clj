(ns org.soulspace.qclojure.adapter.backend.ibmq-backend
  "IBM Quantum backend adapter.

  Implements the QClojure `QuantumBackend` & `CloudQuantumBackend` protocols
  using the martian OpenAPI client defined in
  `org.soulspace.qclojure.adapter.backend.ibmq/ibmq`.

  Design notes:
  * `submit-circuit` returns a job-id (string) per QClojure contract
  * `get-job-status` returns a status keyword
  * `get-job-result` returns a result map with at least :job-status and
    :measurement-results (matching expectations in upstream tests)
  * Authentication mutates internal state atom (cloud style)
  * We keep provider job id separate (internal map tracks mapping)
